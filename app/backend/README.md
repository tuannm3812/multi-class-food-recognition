# FoodLens Backend

This backend provides the FoodLens API contract while the real PyTorch inference
service is being prepared.

## Run Locally

Install runtime dependencies in your preferred environment:

```bash
pip install -r app/backend/requirements.txt
```

Install the optional detector dependency when testing live multi-food image
analysis:

```bash
pip install -r app/backend/requirements-detector.txt
```

Start the API:

```bash
uvicorn app.backend.api:app --reload --port 8000
```

Health check:

```

## Endpoints

```text
POST /predict/image
POST /predict/multi-food/image
POST /predict/video
```

The single-image and video endpoints use real artifacts when available and
fallback predictions when they are not. The multi-food endpoint returns the
Notebook 8 app contract with detected regions, crop-level predictions, decision
bands, and artifact references. It uses live YOLO proposals plus crop
classification when `ultralytics` is installed and marks responses with
`detector_status: live_yolo`. It falls back to a deterministic prototype
response marked with `detector_status: fallback_demo` when the detector runtime
is unavailable.

## Real Inference Integration

To move from mock inference to real inference, place artifacts outside git under
`app/artifacts/` and update `app/backend/inference.py`.

Required artifacts:

- `resnet50_ft_v2_best.pth`
- ordered class names
- calibration temperature
- decision policy
- hard-class list
- confusion-pair list

The multi-food path also uses detector weights through the `ultralytics` runtime.
Set `FOODLENS_DETECTOR_WEIGHTS` to override the default `yolo11n.pt` detector.
